      This driver supports the Bosch BMP180 pressure sensor.
      This driver can be built as a module. The module will be called
      inv-bmp180.

config BMP280

	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Bosch Sensortec
	  digital pressure sensors BMP280.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bmp280-core.

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support Bosch Sensortec digital pressure
	  sensor hooked to an I2C bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bmp280-i2c.
